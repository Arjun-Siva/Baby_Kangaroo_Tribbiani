* Replace every word with its Thesaurus
* Change the words on the page to Pig Latin
* Find the meaning of a highlighted word in a cool way

## Steps to install
1. Download and unzip the repo
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in Google Chrome and click on *Load unpacked*
3. Upload the unzipped extension folder

## Note
* Only the words for which Thesaurus is available in the data/thesaurus.json file will be replaced
* It breaks grammar and doesn't make any sense
